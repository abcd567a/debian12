If you want to receive both ES1090 and UAT978, then two dongles are required, one for 1090 MHz and other for 978 MHz. In this case you will have to serialize dongles so that correct dongle+antenna sets are used by dump1090-fa and dump978-fa.
Serialize dongles as follows </br>

**For 1090 Mhz dongle: use 8-digit serial # 00001090** </br>
**For 978 Mhz dongle : use 8-digit serial # 00000978** </br>

(1) Issue following command to install serialization software: </br>
```
sudo apt install rtl-sdr 
``` 
</br>

(2) Unplug ALL DVB-T dongles from RPi

(3) Plugin only that DVB-T dongle which you want to use for dump1090-fa. All other dongles should be unplugged.

(4) Issue following command. </br>
```
rtl_eeprom -s 00001090 
``` 
</br>
Say yes when asked for confirmation to change serial number.


(5) Unplug 1090 dongle

(6) Plugin only that DVB-T dongle which you want to use for dump978-fa. All other dongles should be unplugged.

(7) Issue following command. </br>
```
rtl_eeprom -s 00000978 
``` 
</br>
Say yes when asked for confirmation to change serial number.


(8) Unplug 978 dongle

IMPORTANT: After completing above commands, unplug and then replug both dongles.


### (9) Configure dump1090-fa and dump978-fa to use their respective dongles.

```
sudo sed -i 's/^RECEIVER_SERIAL=.*/RECEIVER_SERIAL=00001090/' /etc/default/dump1090-fa  
```

```
sudo sed -i 's/driver=rtlsdr[^ ]* /driver=rtlsdr,serial=00000978 /' /etc/default/dump978-fa  
```
